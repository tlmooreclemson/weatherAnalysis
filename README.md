# weatherAnalysis
An attempt to learn Python for data analysis.
The data here can be downloaded for free from meteoblue.com (https://www.meteoblue.com/en/historyplus#try-for-free) I downloaded the weather data for Basel and then began playing around in Python to try and parse the data/plot weather trends.
